# GitHub Desktop Plus

This is a work in progress fork of [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) for Linux with additional features and improvements.

## Features and Roadmap

### General:

- [ ] Customizable **keyboard shortcuts**.
- [x] Red color for destructive action buttons.
- [x] Add **icons** to some similar-looking buttons for faster visual recognition.
- [ ] Bitbucket integration:
  - [ ] Correctly set repository owner (instead of "Other").
  - [ ] Create pull requests.
  - [ ] View pull requests status, including checks.
- [ ] Jira integration:
  - [ ] Create and view Jira issues.
  - [ ] Create branches from Jira issues.

### Repositories list:

- [x] **Pull all** button to fetch and pull from all remotes at once.
- [x] Allow **hiding** the '**Recent**' repositories section.

### Branches list:

- [x] Add warning indicator to **local-only branches** (branches that are not on the remote).
- [x] Allow manually setting which is the **default branch** for a repository (even if it doesn't match the one configured in the remote).

### History tab:

- [x] Use a different style for **merge commits**.
- [ ] **Search commits** by title or message.
- [x] If a commit modifies only 1 file, allow double-clicking the commit to open the file. For other commits, you can still double-click the file as usual.

### Changes tab:

- [x] Context menu option to **permanently discard changes** without sending to trash (useful when the there are many changed files and the regular "Discard" is extremely slow).

## Download and Installation

### Arch Linux

Simply install `github-desktop-plus-bin` from the AUR.

### Other linux distros

Download correct binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/pol-rivero/github-desktop-plus/releases/latest) and copy it to a directory in your `PATH`.

| | **64-bit x86** | **64-bit ARM** | **32-bit ARM** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Debian/Ubuntu** | `-linux-x86_64.deb` | `-linux-arm64.deb` | `-linux-armvhf.deb` |
| **Fedora/RHEL** | `-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `-linux-arm64.rpm` | `-linux-armv7l.rpm` |
| **AppImage (Universal)** | `-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `-linux-arm64.AppImage` | `-linux-armv7l.AppImage` |

### Windows:

Download and execute the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/pol-rivero/github-desktop-plus/releases/latest).

| | **64-bit x86** | **64-bit ARM** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **.EXE Installer** | `-win-x64.exe` | `-win-arm64.exe` |
| **.MSI Installer** | `-win-x64.msi` | `-win-arm64.msi` |

### macOS:

Download the ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/pol-rivero/github-desktop-plus/releases/latest) and extract it. To run the installer, execute the file `GitHub Desktop Plus.app/Contents/MacOS/GitHub Desktop`.

| **64-bit x86** | **64-bit ARM (Apple Silicon)** |
| --- | --- |
| `-macOS-x64.zip` | `-macOS-arm64.zip` |

## Running the app locally

### From the terminal

```bash
corepack enable  # Install yarn if needed
yarn             # Install dependencies
yarn build:dev   # Initial build
yarn start       # Start the app for development and watch for changes
```

- It's normal for the app to take a while to start up, especially the first time.

- While starting up, this error is normal: `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Invalid header: Does not start with Cr24`

- You don't need to restart the app to apply changes. Just reload the window (`Ctrl + Alt + R` / `Cmd + Alt + R`).

- Changes to the code inside `main-process` do require a full rebuild. Stop the app and run `yarn build:dev` again.

- [Read this document](docs/contributing/setup.md) for more information on how to set up your development environment.

### From VSCode

The first time you open the project, install the dependencies by running:
```bash
corepack enable
yarn
```

Then, you can simply build and run the app by pressing `F5`.  
Breakpoints should be set in the developer tools, not the VSCode editor.

### Running tests

I recommend running the tests in a Docker container for reproducibility and to avoid conflicts with your git configuration.  
After installing the dependencies with `yarn`, make sure you have Docker installed and run:

```bash
yarn test:docker
```

## Why this fork?

While the "official" Linux fork of GitHub Desktop is great, I think it's slow in terms of updates and lacks some advanced features that I'd like. This fork has low code quality requirements compared to the official fork, so I (and hopefully you as well) can add features and improvements quickly.

This fork also focuses on integrating nicely with Atlassian products (Bitbucket, Jira, etc.), since I have to use them for work and haven't found a good desktop client for it.

# [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) - The Linux Fork

[![CI](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an open-source [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also publishes [releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

## Installation via package manager

You can use your operating system's package manager to install `github-desktop` and
keep it up to date on Debian and RPM-based distributions.

### Debian/Ubuntu

There are two APT package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need
to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the
releases from this repository.

#### [@shiftkey](https://github.com/shiftkey) package feed

```sh
wget -qO - https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg] https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shiftkey-packages.list'

## Other Distributions

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

### Cross-Distribution Packages

GitHub Desktop is also available cross-platform as a [Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.shiftey.Desktop) and [AppImage](https://appimage.github.io/GitHubDesktop/).

### deb-get

Debian/Ubuntu users can also install directly from this repository using [`deb-get`](https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get): `deb-get install github-desktop`.

## Known issues

If you're having troubles with Desktop, please refer to the [Known issues](docs/known-issues.md#linux)
document for guidance and workarounds for common limitations.

If your package manager is still trying to reach PackageCloud, refer to the
[cleanup instructions](docs/known-issues.md#the-packagecloud-package-feed-is-no-longer-working)
for details about migrating away.

## More information

Please check out the [README](https://github.com/desktop/desktop#github-desktop)
